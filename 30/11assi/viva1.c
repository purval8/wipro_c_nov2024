/*"have a set of three numbered cups: Cup 1, Cup 2, and Cup 3. Initially, Cup 1 contains a ball, while the other two cups are empty. Your task is to write a program that simulates a sequence of swaps between the cups, as specified by the user, and determines the final position of the ball. The user will input a sequence of swaps. Each swap will be represented as a pair of cup numbers (e.g., 1 2 to swap the contents of Cup 1 and Cup 2). After performing all swaps, the program should output the cup number where the ball is located. has context menu " this is problem, give me code in c program, algorithm and flow chrat

BLACKBOXAI

Certainly! Let's break down the problem step by step, including the algorithm, flowchart, and the C code to simulate the cup swapping game.

Algorithm
Initialize three cups: Cup 1, Cup 2, and Cup 3.
Set the initial position of the ball in Cup 1.
Read the number of swaps from the user.
For each swap:
Read the two cup numbers to be swapped.
Perform the swap by checking the position of the ball and updating it accordingly.
After all swaps, output the cup number where the ball is located.

}

/*Explanation of the Code
Initialization: An array cup[3] is used to represent the three cups. The ball starts in Cup 1, so cup[0] is set to 1 and the rest to 0.
Input for Swaps: The program reads the number of swaps and then iterates to read each pair of cups to swap.
Swapping Logic: If the input is valid (between 1 and 3), the contents of the specified cups are swapped.
Final Position: After all swaps, the program checks which cup contains the ball and outputs that cup number.
How to Run the Code
Copy the code into a file named cup_game.c.
Compile the code using a C compiler, e.g., gcc cup_game.c -o cup_game.
Run the executable, e.g., ./cup_game on Unix/Linux or cup_game.exe on Windows.
Follow the prompts to enter the number of swaps and the swaps themselves.
This program will help you simulate the cup swapping game and determine the final position of the ball.

BEGIN
    INITIALIZE cups[3] = {1, 0, 0} // Cup 1 contains the ball
    INPUT numberOfSwaps
    FOR i FROM 1 TO numberOfSwaps DO
        INPUT cupA, cupB
        IF cups[cupA - 1] == 1 THEN
            cups[cupA - 1] = 0
            cups[cupB - 1] = 1
        ELSE IF cups[cupB - 1] == 1 THEN
            cups[cupB - 1] = 0
            cups[cupA - 1] = 1
        END IF
    END FOR
    FOR i FROM 0 TO 2 DO
        IF cups[i] == 1 THEN
            OUTPUT "The ball is in Cup " + (i + 1)
        END IF
