1. What is the size of the DT short unsigned int

Size of the short unsigned int: The size of short unsigned int in C is typically 2 bytes (16 bits).
 However, the exact size can vary depending on the system and compiler being used. You can use the sizeof
 () function to confirm the size on your specific platform.

2.Is C programming Modular? How do you implement it? 

Yes, C programming is modular. This is achieved by
dividing the program into smaller, self-contained functions. These functions can be written in 
separate files (source files). To implement modularity in C:
Use Functions: Break your program into smaller functions, each performing a specific task.
Use Header Files: Define function prototypes and constants in header files (.h), and include these headers in the respective source files.
Use Separate Source Files: Organize your code by putting different functions in separate .c files, which are then compiled together into a single program.

3. What is an object file?

An object file is a file produced by the compiler after it processes the source code. It contains machine code,
which is not yet linked into a complete executable program. The file usually has a .o (Unix) or .obj
(Windows) extension. Object files are later linked together by the linker to create the final executable.
