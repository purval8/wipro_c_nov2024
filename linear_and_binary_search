Linear Search and Binary Search
Both linear search and binary search are algorithms used to search for an element in a collection of data. However, they differ significantly in terms of efficiency, implementation, and the types of data structures they work on.

1. Linear Search
Linear Search (also known as sequential search) is the simplest search algorithm. It works by checking each element in the list, one by one, until the desired element is found or all elements have been checked.

Characteristics of Linear Search:
Time Complexity:
Worst case: 
𝑂
(
𝑛
)
O(n), where 
𝑛
n is the number of elements in the list.
Best case: 
𝑂
(
1
)
O(1) (if the element is found at the first position).
Space Complexity: 
𝑂
(
1
)
O(1), as it requires only a constant amount of space.
Works on: Unsorted and sorted data.
Pros: Simple to implement and does not require any sorting of data.
Cons: Inefficient for large datasets because it may need to check every element.
Algorithm (Pseudocode):
Start at the first element of the list.
Compare each element with the target element.
If a match is found, return the index.
If the element is not found by the end of the list, return a "not found" indicator.
Example: Linear Search in C
c
Copy code
#include <stdio.h>

int linearSearch(int arr[], int size, int target) {
    for (int i = 0; i < size; i++) {
        if (arr[i] == target) {
            return i;  // Return the index if element is found
        }
    }
    return -1;  // Return -1 if element is not found
}

int main() {
    int arr[] = {5, 3, 8, 6, 2};
    int target = 6;
    int size = sizeof(arr) / sizeof(arr[0]);

    int result = linearSearch(arr, size, target);
    if (result != -1) {
        printf("Element %d found at index %d.\n", target, result);
    } else {
        printf("Element %d not found.\n", target);
    }
    
    return 0;
}
Output:

Element 6 found at index 3.
2. Binary Search
Binary Search is an efficient algorithm for finding an element in a sorted array. It works by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half. If the value of the search key is less than the value in the middle of the interval, the search continues in the lower half, or if the search key is greater, it continues in the upper half.

Characteristics of Binary Search:
Time Complexity:
Worst case: 
𝑂
(
log
⁡
𝑛
)
O(logn), where 
𝑛
n is the number of elements in the list.
Space Complexity: 
𝑂
(
1
)
O(1) for the iterative version, 
𝑂
(
log
⁡
𝑛
)
O(logn) for the recursive version (due to recursion stack).
Works on: Only works on sorted data (either in ascending or descending order).
Pros: Much more efficient than linear search for large datasets.
Cons: The data must be sorted, and it’s more complex to implement than linear search.
Algorithm (Pseudocode):
Start with the entire list and find the middle element.
If the middle element is the target, return the index.
If the target is smaller than the middle element, narrow the search to the left half.
If the target is larger than the middle element, narrow the search to the right half.
Repeat steps 2–4 until the target is found or the list cannot be further divided.
Example: Binary Search in C
c
Copy code
#include <stdio.h>

int binarySearch(int arr[], int size, int target) {
    int left = 0, right = size - 1;
    
    while (left <= right) {
        int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;  // Avoid overflow

        if (arr[mid] == target) {
            return mid;  // Return index if element is found
        } else if (arr[mid] < target) {
            left = mid + 1;  // Ignore the left half
        } else {
            right = mid - 1;  // Ignore the right half
        }
    }
    
    return -1;  // Return -1 if element is not found
}

int main() {
    int arr[] = {1, 2, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10};
    int target = 6;
    int size = sizeof(arr) / sizeof(arr[0]);

    int result = binarySearch(arr, size, target);
    if (result != -1) {
        printf("Element %d found at index %d.\n", target, result);
    } else {
        printf("Element %d not found.\n", target);
    }

    return 0;
}

Data Requirements	Works on unsorted and sorted arrays	Requires sorted data (ascending or descending)
Efficiency	Less efficient for large datasets	More efficient for large datasets
Ease of Implementation	Simple to implement	More complex to implement
Best Use Case	Small to medium-sized unsorted data	Large sorted datasets
When to Use Each Algorithm:
Linear Search:

Use it when the list is unsorted, or if the dataset is small, where the overhead of sorting and maintaining sorted data for binary search is not justified.
Suitable for checking if an element exists in a small or unsorted collection.
Binary Search:

Use it when the list is sorted and the dataset is large. Binary search is much faster for large datasets because it reduces the number of elements to be checked logarithmically.
Conclusion:
Linear Search is simple but inefficient for large datasets. It works on both sorted and unsorted data, making it a versatile choice.
Binary Search is very efficient for sorted data, as it reduces the problem size significantly with each step, making it ideal for large sorted arrays.
When working with large datasets where the data is already sorted, binary search is almost always the better choice in terms of performance.

Below are the C programs for both Linear Search and Binary Search algorithms, along with detailed explanations of how they work.

1. Linear Search in C
Linear Search checks each element in the array sequentially until it finds the target element.

C Program for Linear Search
c
Copy code
#include <stdio.h>

// Function to perform linear search
int linearSearch(int arr[], int size, int target) {
    // Traverse the array
    for (int i = 0; i < size; i++) {
        // Check if the element is present at the current position
        if (arr[i] == target) {
            return i; // Return the index if element is found
        }
    }
    return -1; // Return -1 if element is not found
}

int main() {
    int arr[] = {5, 3, 8, 6, 2};
    int target = 6; // Element to search for
    int size = sizeof(arr) / sizeof(arr[0]); // Calculate the number of elements in the array

    int result = linearSearch(arr, size, target); // Call the linearSearch function
    if (result != -1) {
        printf("Element %d found at index %d.\n", target, result); // Element found
    } else {
        printf("Element %d not found.\n", target); // Element not found
    }

    return 0;
}
Output:
mathematica
Copy code
Element 6 found at index 3.
Explanation:
The program searches for the element 6 in the array {5, 3, 8, 6, 2} using a linear search.
The function linearSearch() loops through the array, and when it finds the element 6, it returns the index 3 (because arrays are zero-indexed).
If the element is not found, it returns -1.
2. Binary Search in C
Binary Search works on sorted arrays and repeatedly divides the search interval in half. It is more efficient than Linear Search because it has a time complexity of 
𝑂
(
log
⁡
𝑛
)
O(logn) instead of 
𝑂
(
𝑛
)
O(n).

C Program for Binary Search
c
Copy code
#include <stdio.h>

// Function to perform binary search
int binarySearch(int arr[], int size, int target) {
    int left = 0, right = size - 1;

    while (left <= right) {
        int mid = left + (right - left) / 2; // Calculate middle index

        // Check if target is present at mid
        if (arr[mid] == target) {
            return mid; // Return the index if element is found
        }

        // If target is greater, ignore the left half
        if (arr[mid] < target) {
            left = mid + 1;
        }
        // If target is smaller, ignore the right half
        else {
            right = mid - 1;
        }
    }

    return -1; // Return -1 if element is not found
}

int main() {
    int arr[] = {1, 2, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10}; // Sorted array
    int target = 6; // Element to search for
    int size = sizeof(arr) / sizeof(arr[0]); // Calculate the number of elements in the array

    int result = binarySearch(arr, size, target); // Call the binarySearch function
    if (result != -1) {
        printf("Element %d found at index %d.\n", target, result); // Element found
    } else {
        printf("Element %d not found.\n", target); // Element not found
    }

    return 0;
}
Output:
mathematica
Copy code
Element 6 found at index 3.
Explanation:
The program searches for the element 6 in the sorted array {1, 2, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10} using binary search.
The binarySearch() function repeatedly divides the search range into half by comparing the middle element (mid) with the target. If the target is less than the middle element, it narrows the search to the left half; if greater, it narrows the search to the right half.
The search continues until the element is found or the search range becomes invalid (i.e., left > right).

Binary Search is much faster for large sorted arrays, but requires the data to be sorted before performing the search.*/
